You are given an integer array nums of length n.

A pair of indices (i, j) is called a shadow pair if all of the following conditions are satisfied:


	0 <= i < j < n
	nums[i] < nums[j]
	There does not exist an index k such that i < k < j and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].


Return the total number of shadow pairs.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,1,4,2,5]

Output: 5

Explanation:

(i, j)nums[i]nums[j]Shadow Pair(0, 2)34nums[1] = 1 is not strictly between 3 and 4(1, 2)14No index k exists such that 1 < k < 2(1, 3)12nums[2] = 4 is not strictly between 1 and 2(2, 4)45nums[3] = 2 is not strictly between 4 and 5(3, 4)25No index k exists such that 3 < k < 4


Thus, the answer is 5.

Example 2:


Input: nums = [6,7,8,9]

Output: 3

Explanation:

(i, j)nums[i]nums[j]Shadow Pair(0, 1)67No index k exists such that 0 < k < 1(1, 2)78No index k exists such that 1 < k < 2(2, 3)89No index k exists such that 2 < k < 3

Thus, the answer is 3.


 
Constraints:


	3 <= n == nums.length <= 5 * 104
	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
