You are given an integer array nums of length n.

A pair of indices (i, j) is called a shadow pair if all of the following conditions are satisfied:


	0 <= i < j < n
	nums[i] < nums[j]
	There does not exist an index k such that i < k < j and nums[k] < nums[i] < nums[j].


Return the total number of shadow pairs.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,1,4,1,5]

Output: 3

Explanation:

(i, j)nums[i]nums[j]Shadow Pair(1, 2)14No index k exists such that 1 < k < 2(1, 4)15nums[2] = 4 and nums[3] = 1 are not smaller than 1(3, 4)15No index k exists such that 3 < k < 4

Thus, the answer is 3.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [6,7,6,6,7]

Output: 4

Explanation:

(i, j)nums[i]nums[j]Shadow Pair(0, 1)67No index k exists such that 0 < k < 1(0, 4)67nums[1] = 7, nums[2] = 6, and nums[3] = 6 are not smaller than 6(2, 4)67nums[3] = 6 is not smaller than 6(3, 4)67No index k exists such that 3 < k < 4

Thus, the answer is 4.


Example 3:


Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 6

Explanation:

(i, j)nums[i]nums[j]Shadow Pair(0, 1)12No index k exists such that 0 < k < 1(0, 2)13nums[1] = 2 is not smaller than 1(0, 3)14nums[1] = 2 and nums[2] = 3 are not smaller than 1(1, 2)23No index k exists such that 1 < k < 2(1, 3)24nums[2] = 3 is not smaller than 2(2, 3)34No index k exists such that 2 < k < 3

Thus, the answer is 6.


 
Constraints:


	3 <= n == nums.length <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
